        bio: "My research focuses on large-scale atmospheric dynamics and their influence on regional climate, with a particular emphasis on droughts. I aim to uncover the causal chains behind extreme events, employing statistical methods and machine learning to improve our understanding of these phenomena and refine model projections of extreme events at a regional scale, providing actionable data to support climate adaptation and resilience strategies. Additionally, I am interested in interactions between the ozone layer and climate, examining both interannual variability and long-term trends."
