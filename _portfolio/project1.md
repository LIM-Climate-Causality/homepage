title: Teleconnections
subtitle: One focus is better to understand the underlying large-scale physical drivers and causal mechanisms of extreme events and to quantify these so-called teleconnections. In particular, we are researching the stratospheric polar vortex, the global impacts of Arctic sea ice retreat, and how tropical and extratropical teleconnections interact to drive extreme weather.
